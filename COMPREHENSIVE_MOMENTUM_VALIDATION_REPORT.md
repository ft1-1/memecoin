|--------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| 1.0x (Normal) | ‚ùå NO | ‚ùå NO | ‚ö™ None |
| 2.0x (Moderate) | ‚ùå NO | ‚ùå NO | ‚ö™ None |
| 2.5x (New threshold) | ‚ùå NO | ‚úÖ YES | üìà **EARLY** |
| 3.0x (Old threshold) | ‚úÖ YES | ‚úÖ YES | ‚úÖ Both |
| 4.0x (Strong surge) | ‚úÖ YES | ‚úÖ YES | ‚úÖ Both |

**Key Finding:** **1 additional early signal** detected at the critical 2.5x volume level, enabling earlier entry before momentum becomes widely recognized.

### 3. ‚úÖ Period Reduction Benefit
**Status:** PASS  
**Purpose:** Verify period requirement reduction improves detection speed

**Test Scenarios:**
| Scenario | Old (3p) | New (2p) | Benefit |
|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| Emerging momentum (2 high periods) | ‚ùå NO | ‚úÖ YES | üìà **EARLY** |
| Brief spike (1 high period) | ‚ùå NO | ‚ùå NO | ‚ö™ None |
| Sustained surge (3 high periods) | ‚úÖ YES | ‚úÖ YES | ‚úÖ Both |

**Key Finding:** System now catches emerging momentum patterns that sustain for just 2 periods, providing faster signal generation while maintaining quality (brief spikes still filtered out).

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Dynamic Interval Support
**Status:** PASS  
**Purpose:** Validate dynamic interval calculations for all supported timeframes

**Mathematical Validation:**
| Interval | Minutes | Min Data Points | Calculation | Status |
|----------|---------|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| 1m | 1 | 240 | (4√ó60)/1 = 240 | ‚úÖ PASS |
| 5m | 5 | 48 | (4√ó60)/5 = 48 | ‚úÖ PASS |
| 15m | 15 | 16 | (4√ó60)/15 = 16 | ‚úÖ PASS |
| 1h | 60 | 4 | (4√ó60)/60 = 4 | ‚úÖ PASS |
| 4h | 240 | 1 | (4√ó60)/240 = 1 | ‚úÖ PASS |

**Key Finding:** MomentumAccelerationTracker correctly adapts minimum data requirements based on the actual interval being analyzed, ensuring consistent 4-hour analysis windows regardless of timeframe.

---

### 5. ‚úÖ API Call Reduction Benefit
**Status:** PASS  
**Purpose:** Quantify performance improvements from single 1m data fetch with aggregation

**Performance Analysis:**
- **Tokens analyzed per cycle:** 50 (typical trending list size)
- **Previous approach:** 5 calls/token = **250 total API calls**
- **New approach:** 1 call/token = **50 total API calls**
- **Reduction:** 200 calls (**80% decrease**)
- **Time savings:** ~3.3 minutes per analysis cycle

**Key Finding:** Massive reduction in API overhead enables faster analysis cycles and reduces rate limiting issues, allowing the system to process more tokens more frequently.

---

### 6. ‚úÖ Database Persistence Benefits
**Status:** PASS  
**Purpose:** Verify momentum state persistence across system restarts

**Persistence Scenarios:**
| Scenario | Before Restart | After Restart | Persistence | Status |
|----------|----------------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| System restart during momentum sequence | 15% bonus | 15% bonus | YES | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Long gap between analyses | 25% bonus | 0% bonus | NO | ‚úÖ PASS |

**Key Finding:** ConsecutiveMomentumCalculator properly maintains momentum state in SQLite database, preventing loss of consecutive momentum bonuses during system restarts while still resetting appropriately for stale data.
