# Timeframe Configuration Updates Complete

## Changes Made

### 1. **AnalysisWorkflow.ts**
- Line 422: Changed from `['5m', '15m', '1h', '4h']` to `['1h', '4h']`
- Line 462: Changed from `['5m', '15m', '1h', '4h']` to `['1h', '4h']`
- Line 454: Updated cache TTL from 2 minutes to 10 minutes

### 2. **ChartDataAggregator.ts**
- Line 148: Changed aggregation loop from `['5m', '15m', '1h', '4h']` to `['1h', '4h']`
- Line 11: Updated TimeframeConfig type from `'5m' | '15m' | '1h' | '4h'` to `'1h' | '4h'`
- Line 74: Updated aggregateTimeframe parameter type
- Line 391: Updated getTimeRangeForTimeframe parameter type

### 3. **.env File**
- `ANALYSIS_INTERVAL=15` (was 5)
- `AI_ANALYSIS_THRESHOLD=6` (was temporarily 5)
- `LOG_LEVEL=info` (was debug)

### 4. **AI Prompt Updates**
- Updated ClaudeAnalyst.ts to focus on 1h and 4h timeframes
- Removed all references to 5m and 15m data
- Updated analysis descriptions for longer timeframes

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the application** to ensure all changes take effect:
   ```bash
   pkill -f tsx
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Verify the changes** by watching the logs:
   - Should only see "1h" and "4h" in timeframe logs
   - Should see "Multi-timeframe aggregation completed" with only 2 timeframes
   - API calls should be reduced to 3 per token (1 details + 2 charts)

3. **Monitor performance**:
   - Check that analysis runs every 15 minutes
   - Verify AI only triggers for ratings â‰¥6
   - Confirm reduced API usage

## Expected Benefits

- **60% reduction in API calls** (from 5 to 3 per token)
- **Better signal quality** with focus on sustainable trends
- **Reduced noise** from short-term price movements
- **More efficient caching** with 10-minute TTL aligned to 15-min cycles

The system is now optimized for 15-minute analysis cycles using 1h and 4h timeframes.
