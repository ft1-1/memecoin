# Solana Tracker API Rate Limiting Fixes

## Problem Analysis

The Solana Tracker API was experiencing rate limiting issues that caused:
- 429 "Rate limit exceeded" errors
- "Server error - please try again later" messages  
- Circuit breaker opening due to multiple failures
- Timeouts during multi-timeframe chart data fetching

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Parallel Requests**: Multi-timeframe fetching was making parallel API calls, immediately triggering rate limits
2. **Configuration Mismatch**: Rate limiter was set to 0.5 RPS but request delays were only 1000ms instead of 2000ms
3. **Aggressive Timeouts**: Stagger delays were too short (200ms) and max concurrent requests was too high (2)
4. **Circuit Breaker Issues**: 429 errors were potentially affecting circuit breaker state

## Test Results

### Before Fixes (Parallel Requests)
```
⚡ Parallel: 1 successful, 3 rate limited
   Duration: 1236ms
   Success Rate: 25%
```

### After Fixes (Sequential with 3s delays)  
```
📊 Sequential: 4 successful, 0 rate limited
   Duration: ~9000ms
   Success Rate: 100%
```

## Applied Fixes

### 1. SolanaTrackerClient.ts Configuration

**Rate Limiting Configuration:**
```typescript
rateLimitRps: 0.33,           // Ultra-conservative: 1 request per 3 seconds
requestDelayMs: 3000,         // 3-second delays between requests
```

**Chart Fetch Strategy:**  
```typescript
chartFetchStrategy: {
  primarySource: 'aggregation',
  fallbackEnabled: true,
  staggerDelayMs: 3000,       // 3-second delays (was 200ms)
  maxConcurrentRequests: 1,   // Only 1 concurrent request (was 2)
  cacheFirst: true,
}
```

**Improved Error Handling:**
```typescript
// For rate limit errors, use much longer delays
const multiplier = apiError.rateLimited ? 5 : 2;
const delay = Math.min(baseDelay * Math.pow(multiplier, retryCount - 1), 120000); // Max 2 minutes
```

### 2. RateLimiter.ts Improvements

**Circuit Breaker Logic:**
```typescript
// Specifically EXCLUDE 429 (rate limit) errors from circuit breaker logic
const shouldCountFailure = error && (
  (error.status >= 500 && error.status !== 429) || 
  error.code === 'TIMEOUT' || 
  error.code === 'NETWORK_ERROR'
) && !error.rateLimited;
```

### 3. Environment Configuration (.env)

```env
API_REQUEST_DELAY_MS=3000  # 3-second delays for ultra-conservative rate limiting
```

## Multi-Timeframe Fetching Strategy

The client now uses a **single-request aggregation approach**:

1. **Fetch once**: Get 1-minute data for the maximum time range needed
2. **Aggregate locally**: Transform 1-minute data into 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h timeframes
3. **Cache aggressively**: Cache both source data and aggregated results
4. **Sequential only**: Never make parallel chart requests

This approach:
- ✅ Reduces API calls by ~75%
- ✅ Eliminates parallel request issues  
- ✅ Provides consistent data across timeframes
- ✅ Improves performance through caching

## Recommended Production Settings

For **Free Tier** users:
```env
API_REQUEST_DELAY_MS=3000
rateLimitRps=0.33
chartFetchStrategy.staggerDelayMs=3000
chartFetchStrategy.maxConcurrentRequests=1
```

For **Paid Plans** (higher rate limits):
```env  
API_REQUEST_DELAY_MS=500
rateLimitRps=2.0
chartFetchStrategy.staggerDelayMs=500
chartFetchStrategy.maxConcurrentRequests=2
```

## Testing Scripts

Created comprehensive test scripts to verify fixes:

1. **`test-api-rate-limits.js`** - Basic API connectivity and rate limit testing
2. **`test-multi-timeframe.js`** - Multi-timeframe fetching scenarios  
3. **`test-fixed-rate-limits.js`** - Verification of applied fixes

## Key Recommendations

### ✅ DO
- Use sequential requests with 3-second delays
- Implement aggressive caching for chart data
- Use single-request aggregation for multi-timeframe data
- Monitor circuit breaker state and reset when needed
- Exclude 429 errors from circuit breaker logic

### ❌ DON'T  
- Make parallel chart data requests
- Use delays shorter than 3 seconds for free tier
- Count rate limit errors as circuit breaker failures
- Disable caching for frequently accessed data
- Ignore retry-after headers from 429 responses

## Monitoring

Monitor these metrics to ensure rate limiting is working:
- Request success rate (should be >95%)
- 429 error count (should be <5% of total requests)
- Circuit breaker state (should remain 'closed')
- Average response times (should be 1-3 seconds)
- Cache hit rates (should be >60% for chart data)

## Future Improvements

1. **Dynamic Rate Limiting**: Adjust delays based on API response headers
2. **Plan Detection**: Auto-detect API plan and adjust rate limits accordingly  
3. **WebSocket Integration**: Use WebSocket connections for real-time data when available
4. **Intelligent Caching**: Implement cache warming and predictive prefetching
5. **Circuit Breaker Tuning**: Fine-tune thresholds based on production metrics

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Rate limiting issues resolved with ultra-conservative approach
**Next Steps**: Deploy to production and monitor metrics for 24-48 hours
